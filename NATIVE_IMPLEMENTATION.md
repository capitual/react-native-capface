## Let's go talk about colors 🧑‍🎨

Our SDK has support for some format of the hexadecimal colors and some colors name, but not all.

- **Android**: Support for some hexadecimal colors between **six** and **eight** characters and some colors name. We have support only these colors because we use `parseColor` method in our native module Java. It doesn't support others colors types like RGB, RGBA, HSL and HSLA, [click here to learn more about `parseColor`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Color.html#parseColor(java.lang.String)>). If you have some suggestions to improve it, thank you very much.

- **iOS**: Support for hexadecimal colors only. We have support for this color because we use `UIColor` method in our native module Swift, when we call it in your constructor we provided only hexadecimal `strings`. We didn't find another way per hour to support others colors. If you have some suggestions to improve it, thank you very much.

## Enabling Camera (iOS only)

If you want to enable the camera, you need to add the following instructions in your `Info.plist` file:

```plist
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) need access to your camera to take picture.</string>
```

> That's will be necessary to what iOS **works** correctly!
