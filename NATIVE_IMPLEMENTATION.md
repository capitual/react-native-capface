## Enabling Camera (iOS only)

If you want to enable the camera, you need to add the following instructions in your `Info.plist` file:

```plist
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) need access to your camera to take picture.</string>
```

> That's will be necessary to what iOS **works** correctly!
